# Development Log

## 2026-02-04 (Project Setup)
- **Initial Setup**:
  - Scanned existing directory structure (`data/`, `output/`, `src/`).
  - Created `gemini.md` for project documentation.
  - Created `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive data files (`data/`, `output/`) and system files.
- **Git Initialization**:
  - Initialized git repository.
  - Staged files (`git add .`).
  - **Security Check**: Verified that `data/` and `output/` folders containing Excel/CSV files were correctly ignored by `.gitignore` before committing.
  - Committed changes: "Initial commit: Add project documentation and source code".
  - Configured remote origin: `https://github.com/rjegjin/Project_HighSchool_apply_Analytics`.
  - Pushed to `origin main`.
- **Documentation**:
  - Added instruction to `gemini.md` to reference this log for work continuity.
